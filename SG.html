      <h2>Modern SG (Shooting Guard): Roles, Responsibilities and Famous Players.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"> The shooting Guard is the position with fewest change in
        role since basketball was born. If PG is considered to be the conductor, SG is the musician of a team. Classic
        SGs are players who are a bit higher than PG but must possess impressive finishing and breakthrough skills.
        A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for their team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to
        bring up the ball as well. This article will introduce about roles of a variety SG models, in order to help you
        have clearer look about what position you play in.</p>

      <h2>1. Scoring Shooting Guards.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">The Scoring Shooting Guard are SG players playing in a
        classic style focused on their only mission on the field: Scoring. Despite being called the classic style, the
        Scoring SGs are never outdated in any period of basketball tactics. These SGs are players with extremely diverse
        scoring skills. They are only slightly higher than PG so speed, technique and flexibility are the optimal
        weapons. Scoring SG can often throw both long range and average distance, and is also very dominant in the
        fastbreak or after opponent's error.
        The defensive mission is not a burden of Scoring SGS, but the superstars playing in this position often also
        have great defense capabilities.

      <h2>2. Slashing Shooting Guards.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Like Slashing PG, Slashing SGs are players like holding ball
        and breaking the opponent's defense. Their main task is still to score, but they have more ability to break
        through defenses than Scoring SGs. With his breakthroughs, Slashing SG disrupted the defensive position of the
        opponent, thereby creating more space for players outside the 3-point line or the Big men in the paint area.
        Slashing SGs are usually players with excellent speed and power. These abilities help them develop their skills
        to crossover.
        Slashing SGs are not afraid of collision and very strong in the final shots near the basket. They play like
        "suicide soldiers", are not afraid of the Big Men defending under the opponent's basket and often catch a lot of
        fouls.</p>

      <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
        <p>In modern basketball, the Slashing SG accounts for a small number but always the key in the tactics of the
          team that owns this player model. The most successful players in this role over the past few years are Dwayne
          Wade and Manu Ginobili.</p>
        <p>Dwyane Wade, the greatest Slashing SG of all time.</p>

      <h2>3. 3-point Specialist Shooting Guards.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">In basketball, 3-point shots always bring extreme excitement
        to the audience. Of the 5 positions played on the basketball court, perhaps no other produces more shooters than
        the SG position. A 3pt Specialist can be compared to a sniper assassin. Sniper assassin never has to join in
        battle. Their job is to hide from above and finish the opponent with a single shot.
        So are the sniper assassins in the SG position, they constantly move outside the 3-point line, read the match
        and occupy the gaps, receive the ball from their teammates and score points with instant shots from any
        location. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="img_information">
      <img src="./Image/image 27.png" alt="">
      <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
        <p>The most important thing for 3pt Specialist is the ability to calm, assertive and confidence when throwing
          the hand, because just a little hesitant or distracting is an incorrect throw. They are also the coach's top
          priorities in making important shots at the end of the match.

          The famous 3pt Specialist players can be listed by Ray Allen, Reggie Miller, Klay Thopmson, Steve Kerr ...</p>
        <p>
          Klay Thompson is clearly the most typical model of 3pt Specialist Shooting Guards. He is holding the record of
          most 3pt shot made in a single game of 14 successful shots
        </p>

      <h2>4. Defensive Shooting Guards.</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">If the SG position is the main scorer of a team, the
        Defensive Specialist SG is born to minimize the ability to score of the star SGs on the opponent's side.
        This is a SG model that possess stamina, stubbornness as well as the ability to focus on defending the opponent
        on the other side. They are often players who play extremely uncomfortably, sometimes have psychological attacks
        on your team players. </p>

      <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
        <p>SGs of this type are often not so prominent in their ability to attack. When attacking they usually only have
          the task of stretching the defense or shooting open shots.

          The most well-known Defensive SGs are Bruce Bowen, Tony Allen, Iman Shumpert ...</p>
        <p>
          Bruce Bowen may be the least fair-play player of the NBA history.
