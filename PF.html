            <h2>Modern PF (Power Forward): Roles, Responsibilities and Famous Players.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"> In classic basketball tactics, the task of PF is
                controlling the trapezoidal area with the center. Skills such as catching the ball on the board as well
                as the box out (the skill of taking a good position and pushing the opponent's Big Men out of rebounds)
                are required for a PF. On the offensive front, they can be the home team's drill in situations near the
                basket with Post up skills.
                However, in the era of 3-pointes and the rise of the PGs, the PF position has changed dramatically
                compared to previous era. It's no exaggeration to say that in recent years, PF position has been the
                most tactically important position of a basketball team.</p>

            <h2>1. Classic Power Forwards.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Classic Power Forward is the forward playing the
                original style of the PF position. This PF model is a player with a good height and strong muscles.
                The speed and flexibility of classic PFs is somewhat better than the centers so they are able to defense
                against Wings players (outside players like SG, SF) when needed.
                On the offensive front, these PFs often compete in the area near the basket. They can play pick-and-roll
                or low post. On the defensive front, the classical PF is tasked with the striker to protect the home
                table area of ​​basketball against breakthrough shots on the opponent's basket. Box out skill as well as
                Defensive Rebound are required when they join defense.
                The defensive burden is usually not too heavy, but some stars are also capable of defending 2 to 3
                different positions on the field.

            <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
                <p>Over the past 3 years, the classic PF has significantly disappeared on the NBA courts. Now that the
                    pace of matches and the movement of positions on the pitch is so high that low post opportunities
                    are extremely rare, classic PFs are forced to adapt and change themselves. Some classic PF stars
                    have moved to play in the center of the ball like Tim Duncan or Pau Gasol. It may take a long time
                    to see PFs play in the Classic style like the legends Karl Malone, Denis Rodman, Kevin Garnett,
                    Kevin McHale, Tim Duncan ...

                </p>
                <p>
                    Tim Duncan is the best PF the NBA has ever produced. However, at the end of his career he often
                    played as a center.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Stretch 4 is a style of competition that can be found
                in many PF currently playing in NBA. This type of PF is a player who still possesses the high physical
                necessity for a PF, but they are capable of performing mid-range throws and throws outside the 3-point
                line very well.
                The mission of Stretch 4 is exactly as their name suggests, which is to stretch the opponent's defense
                system. When the home team attacks, the Stretch 4 often moves outside the 3-point line, dragging the
                opponent's PF along and thereby creating a lot of space in the paint area for the players to pass the
                ball or score.

                <p>Currently, that a team plays in the NBA without 1 or 2 PF to throw 3 points. During the era when the
                    coaches prioritized the tactics of creating more space as well as preferring the Small lineup, the
                    Stretch 4 position appeared more and more in NBA matches. These include excellent stretches 4 like
                    Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Bosh, Ryan Anderson, Rashad Lewis, Kevin Love, Shawn Marion ...

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Versatile Power Forward is the new PF style that is
                very popular in the NBA today. These are PFs with very diverse skills and many different playing styles,
                but all have one thing in common is that they play very broad in attack (up to the point of 3 points)
                and are more flexible in the paint compared to the traditional PFs.
                With its versatility, a Versatile PF opens up countless attacks for the home team. The Versatility PF
                will still dominate the tournament for a long time, maybe until a breakthrough strategy is born.

                <p>Anthony Davis is the clearest example of expanding the playing area of current PFs. Stars who used to
                    be traditional PFs like Paul Millsap or Blake Griffin have gradually changed and expanded their
                    scope to adapt to the tactical system of the new era.
                    Versatile PFs are often used to create a wall for players to hold the ball in the outer ring. With
                    its versatility, a Versatile PF opens up countless attacks for the home team.

                in previous and current NBA history. The defender of this type has the ability to defend extremely well.
                They have the main task of stopping opponent’s stars from scoring. These PGs often possess great
                physical strength as well as the ability to concentrate highly during the game. On the offensive front,
                they usually only have simple passes to players who have the ability to create or score better.

                    They are also the start of the home team's counterattack thanks to their ability to steal the ball
