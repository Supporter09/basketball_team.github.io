            <h2>Modern SF (Small Forward): Roles, Responsibilities and Famous Players.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"> Small Forward is the third position on the coach's
                table. This is the position that is considered to be the glue that binds the team and the most versatile
                of the 5 positions on the field.
                SFs also play in the outer ring like SG but tend to be closer to the basket. They often own height and
                body better than SG, some even have the same height as Power Forward but still possess the same speed
                and vertical ability as SG.
                The role of the SF is extremely broad and is determined by the style of the player as well as the
                requirements of the coaches in the defensive or offensive system of each team.
                This article will introduce about roles of a variety SF models, in order to help you have clearer look
                about what position you play in.</p>

            <h2>1. Scoring Small Forwards.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Like all other positions on the field, the SF position
                can absolutely be the main scorer in the offensive system of a team. With the advantage of height and
                strength compared to SG but no less speed, that main scorers playing in the SF position is also very
                popular in NBA teams today. Scoring SFs often possess more diverse scoring skills than Scoring Guard.
                They can throw long-range and average no less than the SG, can break through thanks to speed but can
                also score close to the basket by post ups (pressing people to lead or throw the ball) thanks to similar
                body shape.
                It can be said that the Scoring SF is an upgraded version of Scoring SG with the ability to play low
                post (post up near the basket).

                <p>Before the appearance of Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry, the SF Scoring were the dominant
                    Scoring Champion titles (the title for the player scoring the most average points in a season) of
                    the NBA basketball tournament .
                    From 2007 to 2014, 6 out of 7 times this title belonged to the SF Scoring, including 4 titles of
                    Kevin Durant and 2 titles equally divided between Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kevin Durant (No. 35) is the player with the best scoring ability in the NBA for the last 7 years.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">In fact, Point Forward's models has been used around
                since the 1970s. This is the phrase to call the SF who organize the play of his team. They will take the
                ball from the yard to the half court, then will do the distribution of the ball as a true PG.
                Point Forwards are used in a number of teams with different intentions. That's when coaches who own the
                Sharpshooter PG have the ability to score well, or maybe they just want to minimize the weakness in the
                defender position. Sometimes in some cases they are forced to use Point Forward because simply their SF
                is the best organizer of the team.</p>

            <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
                <p>The most important skill a Point Forward possesses is obviously the ability to pass the ball
                    accurately as well as wide tactical vision. The ability to use other skills such as defense,
                    rebounding, and scoring will determine whether he can be considered a superstar or not.
                    The famous Small Small Forward in the history of NBA can include LeBron James, Paul Pressey, Gordan
                    Hayward or Nicolas Batum ...</p>
                <p>The ability to pass the ball in the SF position is one of the vital skills that make LeBron James the
                    second greatest player in NBA history.</p>

            <h2>3. 3-point Specialist Small Forwards and Defensive Specialist Small Forwards.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Like the 3pts Specialist SG and the Defensive
                Specialist SG, these are the forwards tasked with throwing 3 points (3pt Specialist) or defending
                (Defensive Specialist). The only difference with SG is that the SF can participate in grabbing more
                rebounds and can cover more positions thanks to his height and good bodybuilding.
                Some NBA players have both of these capabilities called "3 and D" players, which means they are supposed
                to be an expert at throwing 3 points when the home team attacks and mentoring star players on your team
                when defense. This is also a very popular player in the NBA today.

                <p>Some of the current talented "3 and D" fowards in the NBA include Paul George, Jae Crowder, Trevor
                    Ariza, Chandler Parson, Rudy Gay, Harrison Barnes ...
                </p>
                <p>

                    Paul George is one of the representatives for the new generation of SFs in the NBA with his
                    outstanding ability to shoot threes and defense

            <h2>4. Combo Forwards. </h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Combo Forward is a model that can play extremely
                flexibly between Small Forward and Power Forward. This type of forward is considered suitable for all
                teams and all different tactics.
                Combo Forward possesses very diverse skills along with height and better body than the regular SF. When
                playing in the SF position, they can attack outside the 3-point arc, break through or average shots.
                When pushed into the position of PF, they can also play post-ups, grab rebounds or play pick-n-roll.</p>
        </div>

            <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
                <p>Perhaps no coach in the NBA does not want to own a Combo Forward in the squad. In the current NBA
                    basketball tournament, Combo Forward are all talented young SFs, with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tobias
                    Harris, Jabari Parker, Robert Covington or Draymond Green.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is possibly the next “King” of the NBA, after the era of
                    Lebron James.
