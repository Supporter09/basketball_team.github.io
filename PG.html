            <h2>Modern PG (Point Guard): Roles, Responsibilities and Famous Players.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);"> The point guard (PG) is one of the five positions in
                a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. Point
                guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to
                the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their
                coach's game plan. They must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing, and they also must
                control the pace of the game. This article will introduce about roles of a variety PG models, in order
                to help you have clearer look about what position you play in.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Playmaker PG is the classic style of PGs, playing
                football right with the mission that this position was born: Control the game and create opportunities.
                Players of this type focus on the task of coordinating the ball for their teammates and deciding which
                offensive tactics to use during each attack. They are always the players who lead the assists statistics
                of the team because they always focus on passing the most favorable passes to the team to score. For
                players of this type, their priority is always "pass-first", which means they always prefer to pass the
                ball over to finish. They also do not need good finishing ability but can also shoot long range when the
                opportunity appears.

                <p>In recent years, with the player leading a game of a team that can come from many different positions
                    on the field, the classic PG is gradually becoming rarer. The outstanding Playmaker Point Guard
                    currently playing in the NBA are only a few players like Chis Paul, Raja Rondo, Ricky Rubio ... Of
                    which only Chris Paul is really reaching the level of a superstar.

            <h2>2. Shooting Point Guards.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">This is the type of PG is dominating in the NBA today
                with the appearance of superstars like Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving or James Harden. They
                have one thing in common: They are long-range and medium-range shooters, combined with breakthrough
                balls that trouble the opponent’s defense. They still have the task of controlling the tempo or creating
                for the teammates, but their top task is still to score. The arrival of Step Curry and the famous
                small-ball squad of the Golden State Warriors opened the trend for the use of the Shooting Point Guard.
                The man who molded a terrifying Golden State and gave Curry a new role was a Sharpshooter Point Guard in
                the '90s, coach Steve Kerr.

            <div style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">
                <p>However, there are still diversity in the way this type of PG plays. If Curry and Lillard are
                    constantly moving without the ball and waiting for the space to receive the handball, Harden and
                    Irving still prefer to take the ball in their hands and break through with the jump or pass the ball
                    to the teammates in more vacant position. Before the current generation of Shooting PG, NBA also had
                    the appearance of some powerful Shooting PGs. These include Curry’s coach Steve Kerr or former
                    superstar Steve Nash.
                </p>
                <p>Stephen Curry, controversially the second best PG of all time, is the most terrifying 3pt Shooter of
                    all time.</p>

            <h2>3. Slashing Point Guards.</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">Slashing Point Guard is also a new form of point guard
                appeared in about 10 years in the NBA. This is a model of muscular guard who has superior fitness to
                other PGs. They are also the main attackers of the team because they can easily overcome other guards
                with bodybuilding as well as their strength. This PG model has the ability to score diversely. They
                prefer to break into the paint area with their speed and strength, which can kill or draw the opponent
                on their own and create a favorable position outside the 3pt arc for shooters. To deal with these types
                of PGs, opponents often have to use players in the SG or SF position to guard or use the 2-to-1 strategy
                (double team). This is also a rare PG model because not all players acquire the sufficient bodybuilding
                and power to play with this role.

                <p>The outstanding Slashing Point Guard players are all NBA stars, including Derrick Rose, John Wall or
                    Russell Westbrook. Especially in the 2016-2017 season, by making Giannis Antetokounmpo to play in
                    the PG position, Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd set an unprecedented scenario when using a 2m11
                    tall player with a 2m21 armspan to play in this position.

                    Back in his time in Chicago Bulls, Derrick Rose, NBA youngest MVP of all time, is a typical Slashing

            <p style="font-size: 20px;color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">This is an extremely rare form of dribbling defender
                in previous and current NBA history. The defender of this type has the ability to defend extremely well.
                They have the main task of stopping opponent’s stars from scoring. These PGs often possess great
                physical strength as well as the ability to concentrate highly during the game. On the offensive front,
                they usually only have simple passes to players who have the ability to create or score better.

                <p>Sometimes they also finish themselves at the opportunity, however their main task is still defense.
                    They are also the start of the home team's counterattack thanks to their ability to steal the ball
                    very quickly. The most famous defensive PG in history is obviously Gary "The Glove" Payton. In NBA
                    today there are still some defensive PG models such as Patrick Berverley or Dante Exum.
